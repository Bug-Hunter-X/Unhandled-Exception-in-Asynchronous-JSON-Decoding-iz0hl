# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous JSON Decoding (Dart)

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart applications when handling asynchronous operations and JSON decoding.  The provided `fetchData` function fetches JSON data from a remote API, but lacks comprehensive error handling.  Specifically, it doesn't account for potential exceptions during `jsonDecode` if the JSON is malformed or if it's missing expected keys.

The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code with missing exception handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution with improved error handling.
